# The PredictHQ API offers two ways to filter by rank.

# You can either filter by rank value
# https://docs.predicthq.com/resources/events/#param-rank
for event in phq.events.search(rank={"gte": 60, "lt": 80}):
    print(event.rank, event.category, event.title, event.start.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))


# or filter by rank level
# https://docs.predicthq.com/resources/events/#param-rank_level
# 1 - Minor (rank between 0 and 20)
# 2 - Moderate (rank between 21 and 40)
# 3 - Important (rank between 41 and 60)
# 4 - Significant (rank between 61 and 80)
# 5 - Major (rank between 81 and 100)
# rank_level accepts either a single value or a list of values
