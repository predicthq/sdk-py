# The PredictHQ Aggregate Event Impact endpoint can be used to find the correlation between your demand and the events data.
# We always aggregate on the date but you can use different impact_rank values to specify how we calculate the impact.
# You will need Data License to access this endpoint and Aviation Rank subscription for Aviation Rank impact.

# You can either aggregate on PHQ Rank by passing impact_rank param as 'rank'.
