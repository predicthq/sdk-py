# Broadcasts usecases

`/broadcasts` endpoint use cases.

The `/broadcasts` endpoint and the `/events` endpoint work the same way. The basics for the `/broadcasts` endpoint are available in this repository. Please refer to the [usecases/events](https://github.com/predicthq/sdk-py/tree/master/usecases/events) for more use cases.
