Giving some extra punch to this farewell excursion, the band are thrilled to announce they\u2019ll be celebrating the ten year anniversary of their hit debut LP \u2018United Paper People\u2019 by playing the record in full, alongside other crowd faves. United Paper People thrust Kisschasy into the kind of blinding spotlight they had never imagined themselves stepping into. Recorded over three weeks in Sydney in February 2005 on what the band call a \u2018moderate budget\u2019, the recording process saw them sleeping on the floor of their booking agents office. With a notion towards writing quality songs with a capability for longevity and not concerning themselves with appealing to a particular scene, the band drew on the lessons learned on their previous EP\u2019s and national touring experience to craft an album that is still a cult classic. Produced by Phil McKellar (Silverchair, Grinspoon), mixed in Seattle by Barrett Jones (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) and released by John Watson\u2019s Eleven imprint, the record yielded great success and cult favourites like \u2018Do Do and Whoa-Oh\u2019s\u2019, \u2018This Bed\u2019, \u2018The Shake\u2019 and \u2018Black Dress\u2019,Kisschasy have dominated on the Big Day Out tour, sold out landmark venues like Melbourne\u2019s Palace Theatre and Sydney\u2019s Enmore Theatre. They\u2019ve scooped up two gold singles, two gold albums and been nominated for multiple ARIA Awards. They\u2019ve stormed into both the Hottest 100 and the Top 20 on the ARIA Charts. All in their distinctly self-possessed ways. Kisschasy have released three albums that vocalist Darren Cordeaux says \u201cI believe will stand the test of time and will always represent an incredible time in our lives\u201d. Now, it is time to farewell that time, with band members occupied with various other projects, both personal and professional.Kisschasy are truly one of Australian pop-punk\u2019s landmark acts; insatiable on-stage, adaptable and always emotive in the studio. Do not miss this final tour. There will be sing-alongs. Loud and clear. ",

Fast forward to 2015 and Thirsty Merc are still excited to be making music, but all things must change and after selling over 200,000 records with Warner Music, this time around the band are tackling the recording and release of their fourth studio album, and first new material in five years, independently, and very differently. Following songwriting sessions in Sydney, Melbourne, and Los Angeles, the band were ready to get back into the studio and to help realise their vision they utilised crowdfunding platform PledgeMusic, to help get the record recorded and mixed and the response has been overwhelming. In fact, the band reached its goal within 48 hours of the campaign. With the recording now complete, with production by long time collaborator, Lindsay Gravina (The Living End, Kate Miller Heidke, Roland S Howard), Thirsty Merc have booked Grammy nominated Emily Lazar (Foo Fighters, David Bowie, Sia and The Killers) to master the record in New York ahead of its Australian release on 14 August.Thirsty Merc Website",

          "description": " School of Rock Macarthur School of Rock presents A Tribute to The Beatles - The Beatles are one of the most successful bands in history. Coming from working class Liverpool in the UK, they created the British Invasion of popular music.

This grunge-rock trio was formed with a mutual love for bands such as Foo Fighters, and Violent Soho. With nothing left to lose and only their non-existent reputation to tarnish, their indie cred is becoming history as they embrace the battle of selling out to the mainstream radio stations.Being Jane Lane are an all gal, punk/rock group from Brisbane/Gold Coast combing many influences to creating a hard hitting head banging sound. These girls have been working audiences into a sweat for the past year and are eager to keep the good vibes rolling.Opening the night will be Fooligans.",

This record would encapsulate the wide array of influences from all 3 members, from punk, grunge, to modern indie. \u2018Evolve\u2019 epitomized the bands desire for diversity, fun and drive not to become one dimensional. With the foundations strongly set the remainder of the year saw the band travel throughout NSW with their energetic live show\u201ctheir music was impressively focused and confident, with tinges of Nirvana in places\u201d - Alex Needham \u2013 The Guardian. Singles \u2018Another Thought\u2019, received airplay on community radio stations nationwide as well as Triple J\u2019s Unearthed Radio, while their video for \u2018The Bike\u2019 featured on ABC\u2019s RAGE TV as well as notching up 50,000+ views online.Early 2014 and work began on their new material. The trio found sanctuary in a secluded farmhouse in rural New South Wales, far from the distractions of city life. A new approach, new surroundings and a different writing method would be the reasoning for such escape. This time away would birth what would be the bands follow up tracks to \u2018Evolve\u2019.Mixed by Simon Todkill (The Griswolds, Matt Corby), and Mastered by 2x Grammy Nominee Joe LaPorta (Foo Fighters, The Killers), Village Echoes return with the infectiously catchy new single \u2018You Are Mine\u2019.Village Echoes is Alex Almasi (Guitar/Vox), Steve Parfitt (Bass/Vox) and James Pounsett (Drums)",
